Volunteers in Tutoring at Lawrence (VITAL) is an organization that was put together in response to COVID-19.
The organization connects student volunteers from Lawrence University with high schooler students from Appleton, WI.
The LU volunteers help the high school students with the transition to online learning via online tutor sessions.
I volunteered as a math and english tutor from April 2020 until summer break, June 2020.
