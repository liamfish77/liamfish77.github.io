Optimistic is a recording that the Lawrence University Jazz Ensemble put together remotely during our 2020 Spring trimester.
I can be heard featured on drums.
A big thanks to band director Patty Darling, who facilitaed the project.

In the Jazz Band Live link I can be found playing auxiliary percussion.
Thanks to Jos√© Encarnacion for directing the band.
